Recommendation system

This project is all about recommendation system. Recommendation systems are built to predict what users might like, especially when there are lots of choices available. They can explicitly offer those recommendations to users or they might work behind the scenes to choose which content to surface without giving the user a choice. A book recommendation system is designed to recommend books of interest to the buyer. Our first recommender is popularity based where we have most popular books, Author and Publisher. The recommendation was built using different algorithms such as Collaborative filtering-based recommendation, User-based filtering, Item based filtering, Model Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender.
